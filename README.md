Plant Watering and Monitoring System
COMP3000 Computing Project 2022/2023
---
## Project Vision
### Overview
This project will be for the purpose of computerising the detection of water levels in plant soil in order to adjust these water levels through watering in order to meet the optimum requirements of the plants. By computerising this process, it may be automated and therefore should increase its efficiency and ease.
### Technology
The Plant Watering and Monitoring System will utilise an embedded single board computer that has the ability to detect water levels for the purpose of detecting them in plant soil. Data concerning the plant health will be sent to a Microsoft Azure server, which will be retrieved by a simultaneously desktop and mobile application in order for presentable and abstracted user viewing. The desktop and mobile application will be written in C# with the use of the .NET MAUI framework. For this reason, it will be able to be distributed to build natively for both mobile and desktop environments.
### Stakeholders
The Plant Watering and Monitoring System will be, paramount, for the sake of aiding the developer of this project. The reason for this is due to the fact that the developer participates in amateur horticulture. Additionally, the Plant Watering and Monitoring System would also be equally beneficial for any other amateur horticulturalists. If extended upon in scope, it would also be beneficial for professional, industrial horticulture.
### Purpose
The purpose of the Plant Watering and Monitoring System is derived from the principal issue that watering plants traditionally requires consistent manual labour. This of course requires time, which is an issue for amateur horticulturalists who, in particular, probably do not have much time to attend to their plants. Correspondingly, it is also a larger scale issue within an industrial context, where manual labour requires significant expenditures. For this reason, the Plant Watering and Monitoring System could conserve significant amounts of time for amateurs and professionals. Money could also be conserved with regards to industrial horticulture, which could possibly be utilised elsewhere for the net benefit of the economic output.
